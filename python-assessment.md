# Python Developer Practical Assessment

## Project: Task Management API with CLI Interface

Build a RESTful Task Management system with both an API backend and a command-line interface.

### Time Limit
4-5 hours

### Core Requirements

#### 1. Task Management API
Create a RESTful API with the following endpoints:
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- List tasks with filtering capabilities
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Assign priority levels to tasks

#### 2. Data Persistence
- Implement data storage (your choice of database/storage method)
- Ensure data persists between application restarts

#### 3. CLI Interface
Build a command-line tool that allows users to:
- Interact with the task management system
- Perform CRUD operations via terminal commands
- Display tasks in a readable format

#### 4. Business Logic
- Tasks should have: title, description, status, priority, created date, due date
- Implement basic validation for task data
- Handle edge cases appropriately

### Technical Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include a README with setup and usage instructions
- Include requirements.txt for dependencies

### Deliverables
1. Source code with clear project structure
2. README.md with:
   - Setup instructions
   - API endpoint documentation
   - CLI usage examples
   - Any assumptions made
3. Requirements.txt file

### Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated on:
- Code quality and organization
- Functionality and completeness
- Error handling
- Documentation clarity

### Submission
Please submit your code via a Git repository (GitHub/GitLab) or as a compressed archive.

**Note:** Focus on writing clean, maintainable code rather than implementing every possible feature. Quality over quantity.
